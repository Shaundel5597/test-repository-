        <h1> About Me Page</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Shaundel, I was born and raised on the east end of Long Island, New York. Southampton to be
            exact. I come from a big close knit family, where I am the oldest of 5 and my grandparents, aunts, uncles,
            are no farther than a 15 minute drive. All my life I played football and dreamed of going to a big college
            and playing there. Some incidents happened where that was hindered, I injured myself and realized that
            football could be a real risk of damaging what was already damaged.

            Before taking this journey on this Nebula Academy path I went to college and studied Exercise Science,
            didn't like the area, so I came back to Long Island and attended a community college. There I studied
            Graphic Design to be a Graphic Artist. At the same time I worked at a golf course in Southampton on my off
            days or even after class. I've always been good at art and realized I should find a field in something I'm
            already good at so when I get a job it wouldn't feel like I was working or dreading work.

        <h5> From Exercise Science to Graphic Artist Now to Aspiring Programmer </h5>

            When I got to the school I played football at I thought I wanted to be a Physical Therapists. Started going
            to classes and found out there were labs that were a sepperate part from the lecture. I liked it at first
            until the tests came around and the different region of the body and systems were confusing. I didnt do
            horrible in the class but definitely sought extra help. I then moved back and started my journey onto being
            a Graphic Artist where I liked the classes because everything came so easy since I was already pretty good.
            Still want to finish and get my degree in it but I've been given this oppurtunity and have been told i can
            work this in with some graphic design things.
